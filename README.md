What's the fun of using a pivot table out-of-the-box when you can write a ton of VBA code to do something similar?

The text file contains a script that loops through thousands of lines of daily stock trade data, calculates yearly high/low/delta and creates a summary table displaying this info for each stock.  It also loops through tabs in the Excel which each containing a different year.  Checkout the image file screen shots for examples of how the data is structured, along with the output.  Some conditional formatting is also coded based on a negative vs positive net change for the year.
